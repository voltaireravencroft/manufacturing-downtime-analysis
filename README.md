# Manufacturing Line Downtime Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of production line efficiency and operator performance for a soda bottling facility, identifying key downtime factors and operator-specific error patterns.

## Business Questions
1. What's the current line efficiency?
2. Are any operators underperforming?
3. What are the leading factors for downtime?
4. Do any operators struggle with particular types of errors?

## Key Findings
- **Line efficiency: 67.1%** with 33% productivity loss due to downtime
- **Product spills** are the #1 cause of downtime (338 minutes)
- **Mac underperforms** at 63.3% efficiency vs Charlie's 71.0%
- **Operator-specific error patterns identified** enabling targeted training

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Data analysis: VLOOKUP, SUMIF, AVERAGEIF
- Visualization: Column charts, stacked bar charts

## Recommendations
Immediate Actions (0-30 days):

Implement spill prevention training for all operators, focusing on handling procedures during product changeovers and transfers. This addresses the #1 downtime cause (338 minutes).
Provide targeted coaching to Mac on batch change procedures and coding protocols. Consider pairing Mac with Charlie for shadowing/mentorship on these specific tasks.
Schedule machine operation refresher training for Charlie and Dennis, focusing on proper adjustment techniques to reduce the 238 combined minutes lost to this error type.

Short-term Actions (30-90 days):

Conduct root cause analysis on machine failures (261 minutes) - determine if failures are preventable through better preventive maintenance or operator handling.
Review inventory management processes with supply chain team to address the 229 minutes lost to shortages. Implement buffer stock or improved forecasting.
Establish operator performance metrics dashboard to track efficiency and downtime patterns on an ongoing basis, enabling early intervention when performance degrades.

Long-term Strategic Actions (90+ days):

Develop standardized work procedures for all high-error tasks, particularly batch changes and machine adjustments, incorporating best practices from top performers.
Implement a continuous improvement program with monthly operator reviews focused on error reduction and efficiency gains.
